## 💡 How to Use / Run

For each folder/task:

1. Navigate to the specific folder (e.g. `cd 5_Data Visualization using Python`)
    
2. If there’s code (Python, scripts, etc.), run it (e.g. `python script.py`)
    
3. Check outputs, visualizations, logs, or results as required


You may need to install dependencies (e.g. Python packages). Use something like:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(if you include a `requirements.txt` in relevant folders)
